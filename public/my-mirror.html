<div class="intro-text">
  This mirror reflects not just who I am but everything society told me not to be. Each piece here is a gesture, a scream, a whisper, a moment I reclaimed through Butoh and opera. I move not to entertain, but to break silences. I sing not to impress, but to resurrect memories buried under fear.

    <p class="performance-title">Carmen</p>
    <p>In this operatic performance, I embody the seduction of power and the punishment of desire. Carmen has always been misunderstood. I let her live in my own voice and in the haunting fire of rebellion.</p>

    <p class="performance-title">Reclaiming Lost Childhood</p>
    <p>This Butoh was born from grief. The moments stolen by trauma, by shame, by forced conformity. I move like a child who refuses to stay buried.</p>

    <p class="performance-title">O Fortuna</p>
    <p>Here, I surrender to the forces of fate, screaming through movement that I was never meant to be quiet. It's a storm. Raw and unfiltered.</p>

    <p class="performance-title">Der Holle</p>
    <p>Through this I visit the darkness society builds around femme bodies, queer souls, and sacred rage. The underworld is not hell. It is truth unleashed.</p>

    <p class="performance-title">Lacrimosa</p>
    <p>My weeping body in this Butoh channels the grief of exile. From churches, families, nations. Every tear here carries a hymn.</p>

    <p class="performance-title">Crossing the Threshold</p>
    <p>I wear a skirt. Not to be seen, but to see who dares to look. This performance was a field study, a protest, a prayer. I crossed not just a physical line, but a social one.</p>
